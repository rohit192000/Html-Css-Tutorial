                one, in the following sections.

                <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects
                fall
                somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
                and just
                the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
                intrigued
                by are as folows, in order of priority:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol
                    (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
                <li>Measuring the effect on peformance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding
                    30<sup>&deg;</sup>C(86<sup>&deg;</sup>F), when the
                    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x
                    10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
                <li>
                    <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr
                        title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
                the
                research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
                Thanks.

                <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To
                answer your question,
                my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                <dd>
                    A liitle known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr
                        title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around
                    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
                </dd>
                <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                <dd>
                    Before the Icelander developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,
                    which
                    involved huddling close together in a close circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around
                    in imperceptibly
                    tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance
                    inspired
                    modern style such as Twerking.
                </dd>
                <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                <dd>
                    An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
                    discovered a new dance style charactersied by "robotic", stilled movements, being practiced by
                    inhabitants
                    of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like
                    this
                    because they were really cold.
